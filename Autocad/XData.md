### Overview
Extended Entity Data (XData) is a legacy mechanism to attach additional information to AutoCAD entities. I say "legacy" as there are limits inherent to using XData, which make other mechanisms more appropriate when storing significant amounts of data. The global XData limit is 16 KBytes per object, and this potentially needs to be shared between multiple applications.

### Limitation
- You can store up to 16K of data on objects.
