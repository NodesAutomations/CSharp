### Overview
- Jig basically allows you to preview something before it is actually drawn in the model space – and moreover, it allows you to dynamically change the end result of what is drawn, according to certain inputs.
- The circle jig is a jig that is built by the boffins at AutoDesk. You too can make your own jigs. Perhaps more complex ones.
