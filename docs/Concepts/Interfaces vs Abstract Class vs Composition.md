### When to Prefer inheritance over Composition?

If A is B then Prefer inheritance , If A has B then Prefer Composition

### When to Prefer Abstract Class vs Interface?

Use abstract clases and inheritance if you can make the statement **“A is a B”**. Use interfaces if you can make the statement **“A is capable of [doing] as”,** or also, abstract for what a class is, interface for what a class can do.
